Hello, I am Ali Baykara, I am 28 years old, I live in istanbul. I worked as a electrical and electronics technician for 1 year, but I decided to quit my job because I was not satisfied. I have been involved with technology since my childhood. As technology progressed over time, my curiosity increased and I said it's time to learn. I am trying to improve myself on the software path where I am in the training process. My goal is to be a Software Developer .
I am sure that I will see the benefits of being curious and willing in this profession in which I am trying to be successful.
I like to learn and share what I have learned.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / REACT/PHP/
